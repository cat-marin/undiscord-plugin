# undiscord-plugin
undiscord, but it's a plugin

# why
why not? i used it in the browser, but wanted it available in the electron app without having to inject code into the console.

# disclaimer
i am not the original creator of undiscord nor do i claim to be! that would be victornpb. 

go ahead and check out their github [here](https://github.com/victornpb/deleteDiscordMessages)!
